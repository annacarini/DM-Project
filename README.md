# External Multi-Pass Sorting Algorithm

This is a web application for visualizing the external multi-pass sorting algorithm.

It has been realized as a project for the Data Management course from the master's degree in Engineering in Computer Science at the university "La Sapienza" of Rome.

[The application is available here.](https://annacarini.github.io/External-Multipass-Sorting/)

## Tools
The application's graphics have been realized using the library [Two.js](https://two.js.org/), combined with the library [Tween.js](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js) to manage the animations.

## Controls
